Styling with CSS: The project showcases the use of CSS for styling purposes. Through meticulous styling, it not only ensures visual appeal but also reinforces the importance of maintaining separation between content and presentation.

Responsive Design Considerations: Although the project primarily focuses on basic concepts, it may incorporate minimal responsive design practices to introduce considerations for various screen sizes.

### Objective:

The primary objective of this project is to provide a platform for practical exploration, enabling a comprehensive review of essential HTML and CSS concepts. By exclusively utilizing these technologies, the project aims to build a strong foundation for more advanced web development endeavors.

#### Conclusion:

This practice project is an invaluable resource for anyone seeking to refresh their understanding of fundamental web development concepts. Through hands-on coding and experimentation, it empowers learners to gain confidence in using HTML and CSS, laying the groundwork for more complex projects and a deeper exploration of web technologies.
